# Laravel Appleseed
## Reasoning
Eliminate error and server log entries that get thrown by missing favicons, especially the apple-touch-icon.png errors.

### Dependencies
- Your project should be running Laravel 4+.

## Installation
1. Install Laravel Appleseed via composer:
  ```sh
  composer require genealabs/laravel-appleseed
  ```

2. Add the service provider entry in `config\app.php`:
  ```php
  GeneaLabs\LaravelAppleseed\LaravelAppleseedServiceProvider::class,
  ```

## Usage
That was it! It will inspect each route for favicon requests and handle it appropriately.
